# ðŸ“˜ Project Best Practices

## 1. Project Purpose
A minimal TypeScript + Express web application that allows users to upload PDF files and download them later. The repository is intentionally crafted for demo/education, including security issues (e.g., a path traversal vulnerability) to showcase detection and remediation using Snyk. Domain: web API + static site serving with file upload/download.

## 2. Project Structure
- Root
  - `index.ts` â€” Express app definition, routes, and server bootstrap (currently combined).
  - `public/` â€” Static site assets (frontend HTML). The page expects an endpoint to list downloadable files.
  - `tests/` â€” Jest tests and binary fixtures for upload/download flows.
  - `package.json` â€” Scripts and dependencies.
  - `tsconfig.json` â€” TypeScript configuration.
  - `.snyk`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`.

Recommended refinements for maintainability:
- Split app from server bootstrap to avoid side-effects on import:
  - `src/app.ts` exports the configured Express `app` only.
  - `src/server.ts` imports `app` and calls `app.listen(...)`.
- Use `src/` + `dist/` convention and configure `tsconfig.json` with `outDir: "dist"` and `rootDir: "src"`.
- Align scripts and emitted paths:
  - Ensure `start` references the correct compiled file (e.g., `node dist/server.js`).
  - Ensure `build` produces artifacts under `dist/` (configure `outDir`).
- Ensure frontend and backend endpoints match. `public/index.html` calls `GET /download` for a listing, which is not currently implemented.

## 3. Test Strategy
- Frameworks: Jest + Supertest (with `ts-jest` for TypeScript).
- Location: `tests/` directory. Uses fixtures `tests/test.pdf` and `tests/test.jpg`.
- Style:
  - Prefer `request(app)` (Supertest can accept an Express app) to avoid binding to a port and to prevent double listeners.
  - If a server is needed, use ephemeral ports: `app.listen(0)` and close in `afterAll`.
  - Keep tests hermetic: write temp files under a test-specific temp directory (e.g., `os.tmpdir()`), and clean up in `afterAll`.
  - Distinguish unit tests (pure logic, no I/O) from integration tests (HTTP, filesystem). Use tags or folders if the suite grows.
- Mocking guidelines:
  - For logic around filesystem or cloud storage, prefer mocking with `jest.mock('fs')` or wrappers to isolate behavior.
  - For upload validation, consider testing with small sample buffers rather than large binaries.
- Coverage expectations:
  - Aim for high coverage on routing, validation, and error handling paths.
  - Include negative tests: invalid file types, missing fields, non-existent downloads, and traversal attempts.

## 4. Code Style
- TypeScript
  - Keep `strict: true` and enable additional safety options where feasible (`noImplicitReturns`, `noUnusedLocals`, etc.).
  - Prefer explicit types for Express handlers: `(req: Request, res: Response)`.
  - Use `async/await` for I/O where applicable; wrap with `try/catch` and forward to Express error middleware.
  - Keep modules side-effect free; do not `listen()` in the same file that defines routes.
- Naming conventions
  - Files: `kebab-case` for JS/TS modules; tests as `*.test.ts` mirroring the module name.
  - Variables and functions: `camelCase`; classes: `PascalCase`.
  - Route files by resource: `routes/uploads.ts`, `routes/downloads.ts`, etc.
- Comments and docs
  - Keep comments purposeful: document security assumptions, validation logic, and non-obvious constraints.
  - Prefer self-documenting code; add JSDoc for public functions.
- Error handling
  - Validate inputs early; respond with precise status codes (400, 404, 415, 413, etc.).
  - Centralize error handling with Express error middleware. Avoid leaking internal errors to clients.

## 5. Common Patterns
- Express structure
  - Use `Router()` per resource and mount under `/api/...` or clear resource paths.
  - Separate layers: route -> controller/handler -> service -> persistence/FS abstraction.
- File uploads (Multer)
  - Configure a `fileFilter` to restrict to PDFs by content-type and/or file signature (magic bytes), not just extension.
  - Set file size limits to prevent abuse.
  - Store uploads outside the project root or in a dedicated directory; ensure itâ€™s gitignored and cleaned during tests.
- Secure downloads
  - Normalize and validate paths with `path.resolve` and ensure the resolved path stays within the allowed directory.
  - Do not directly interpolate user-provided paths. Map IDs to stored files, or whitelist filenames.
  - Stream responses efficiently and handle `ENOENT` with 404.
- Configuration
  - Read settings from environment variables (`PORT`, upload dir, limits). Use a small config module.
  - Avoid hardcoding ports; default to `process.env.PORT ?? 3000`.
- Observability
  - Add minimal logging (structured if possible). Log errors with correlation IDs for integration tests.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts
- Do
  - Enforce validation on upload (MIME type + magic bytes) and set size limits.
  - Separate app construction from server startup; export `app` for tests.
  - Ensure TS build emits to `dist/` and runtime scripts point to the correct files.
  - Implement `GET /download` (list) if the frontend depends on it, and return JSON array of allowed files.
  - Use safe path resolution and disallow traversal outside the upload directory.
  - Return consistent errors and statuses; test both success and failure paths.
  - Add ESLint + Prettier and a consistent formatting/linting pipeline.
  - Keep `uploads/` out of version control and clean it in test teardown.
- Don't
  - Donâ€™t compose file paths directly from untrusted input.
  - Donâ€™t start the HTTP server at import time.
  - Donâ€™t trust only client-declared MIME type; inspect server-side.
  - Donâ€™t write test artifacts into the repo folder; use temp directories.
  - Donâ€™t leave frontend-backend contract mismatches unresolved.

## 7. Tools & Dependencies
- Runtime
  - `express` â€” HTTP server and routing.
  - `multer` â€” Multipart handling for uploads.
- Dev/Test
  - `typescript` â€” Language and build.
  - `jest` + `ts-jest` â€” Testing with TypeScript.
  - `supertest` â€” HTTP integration testing.
- Setup suggestions
  - Add `jest.config.ts` with `preset: 'ts-jest'` and proper test regex.
  - Configure `tsconfig.json` with `rootDir: 'src'`, `outDir: 'dist'`.
  - Scripts (example):
    - `build`: `tsc`
    - `start`: `node dist/server.js`
    - `test`: `jest --runInBand`

## 8. Other Notes
- The repository intentionally includes a path traversal vulnerability for demonstration. When hardening, ensure download routes strictly confine access to the uploads directory and prefer ID-based lookups.
- The frontend expects a `GET /download` listing endpoint; align API and UI to avoid dead calls.
- For LLM-generated code: follow the separation-of-concerns pattern, avoid side effects in modules, keep validation and error handling explicit, and prefer adding tests with any new routes or behaviors.

# Project security best practices

- Always run Snyk Code scanning tool for new first party code generated.
- Always run Snyk SCA scanning tool for new dependencies or dependency updates.
- If any security issues are found based on newly introduced or modified code or dependencies, attempt to fix the issues using the results context from Snyk.
- Rescan the code after fixing the issues to ensure that the issues were fixed and that there are no newly introduced issues.
- Repeat this process until no issues are found.
